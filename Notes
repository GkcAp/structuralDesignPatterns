To use an adapter:

The client makes a request to the adapter by calling a method on it using the target interface.
The adapter translates that request on the adaptee using the adaptee interface.
Client receive the results of the call and is unaware of adapter’s presence.

#Advantages:

* Helps achieve reusability and flexibility.
* Client class is not complicated by having to use a different interface and can use polymorphism to swap between different implementations of adapters.


#Disadvantages:

* All requests are forwarded, so there is a slight increase in the overhead.
* Sometimes many adaptations are required along an adapter chain to reach the type which is required.
